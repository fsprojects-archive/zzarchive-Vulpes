CUDA.NET aims to provide access to CUDA functionality from .NET based applications
on windows and linux systems.

CUDA is a GPU computing library provided by NVIDIA Corp.
For more information you may take a look at: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda

The CUDA.NET library has been modified by Hybrid DSP Systems to support:
	CUDA Toolkit >=3.2 (64-bit pointers and _v2 versions of NVCUDA Functions)

	* Added sample program to demonstrate loading of kernels and executing functions
	  on the device.

Release 1.1 beta:
	The attached library conforms to CUDA 1.1 API.
	Please note that prior to using the library that your system has a CUDA
	toolkit installed, version 1.1, and you have a CUDA compatible computing
	device (such as Tesla C870, GeForce 9600GT etc.)
	If using the library under Windows, verify that the driver nvcuda.dll is 
	located under system32 directory of your windows installation.
	If used under linux, verify that libcuda.so is located in one of $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	directories (specifically, under the installation directory of CUDA toolkit.)

Release 1.1 alpha:
	The attached library conforms to CUDA 1.1 API.
	Please note that prior to using the library that your system has a CUDA
	toolkit installed, version 1.1, and you have a CUDA compatible computing
	device (such as Tesla C870, GeForce 9600GT etc.)
